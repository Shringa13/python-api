DSDJ Technical Workshop on Using APIs with Python

Want to learn how to use Web APIs to get more data for your projects? Companies like Yelp, Uber, and Airbnb are using Web APIs for their applications and understanding how these programs work will allow you to be more aware about how you can retrieve data for your applications. Web APIs are on the rise and having a good understanding on how to use it will only make you a better skilled data scientist. 

In this technical workshop, we'll dive into how you can use Web APIs to get data for your future projects or applications and learn:
- What are Web APIs and Why it's so important to know
- How Web APIs work 
- What the basics of a REST Architecture is, including Client-Server, JSON, and API Keys
- How you to register for an API account 
- How to navigate an API Documentation
- How to use the Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data

Last but not least, we'll end this workshop with a jupyter notebook code demonstration on how you can use the Open Weather Map API step by step! There's a lot to learn and we hope to see you there!
